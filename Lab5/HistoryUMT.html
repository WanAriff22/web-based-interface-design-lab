  <h1>History of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu</h1>
  <div class="articleHistoryUMT">
    <div class="text">
    <p>
      Universiti Malaysia Terengganu began as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia's Centre for Fisheries and Marine Science,
      located at Mengabang Telipot, Kuala Terengganu. It provided facilities for both students and lecturers from the 
      Fisheries and Marine Science programmes to conduct their practical sessions and also research.</p>
    <p>
      Eventually, the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) in Serdang was 
      transferred to Kuala Terengganu, and the Centre transformed into a branch campus, being renamed Universiti 
      Pertanian Malaysia Terengganu (UPMT) in June 1996. The name of the faculty was also changed to the Faculty of 
      Applied Sciences and Technology.</p> 
    <p>
      Also formed were the Faculty of Science and Professional Literature and the Matriculation Centre. 
      Later on, the Cabinet of Malaysia approved the establishment of Terengganu University College (KUT) on 5 May 1999 
      as an associate campus of UPM. Then Terengganu University College was given autonomy on 1 May 2001 and was renamed 
      Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia (KUSTEM) on 20 June 2001.</p>
    <p>
      On 1 February 2007, KUSTEM was given the status of a full-fledged university, and with that elevation, 
      it was renamed again and remains to this very day as Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. At the same time, 
      KUSTEM's emblem was rehashed as the University's emblem.In 2015, the university was granted autonomy status.</p>
